# Joshua Suh's porfolio website

I'm writing this website to mainly learn how JS, CSS and HTML interacts with each other. The trifecta!!!

It might be prudent to host my projects on something more stable, on services like Squarespace or Wordpress, but I'm taking this as a learning moment. I've always been curious about how the frontend stuff worked in the first place.

Using node.js, I created a project with React and Vite, and using Tailwind CSS to drive the style.

I'm also learning bit more about WebGL and Three.js. It seems hard to understand, but I want to learn!
